# React Hooks

React Hooks continue to be a powerful and essential feature for writing functional components with state and side effects. Hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` remain foundational, while newer additions and refinements like `useId` (for generating stable unique IDs), `useDeferredValue` (for smoother UI responsiveness), and `useTransition` (for managing concurrent state updates) enhance performance and user experience in concurrent rendering scenarios. These hooks enable developers to write cleaner, more modular code without relying on class components, aligning well with React's modern architecture and features like automatic batching and concurrent mode.
